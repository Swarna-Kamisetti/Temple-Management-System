<p>Bereft of any other refuge in God who is merciful like Goddess Mahalakshmi, has come in human form of Andal.<br>
She is like a wish fulfilling creeper, that makes the family of Periyaalvar happy.<br>
With her inner eye, she always sees and dwells on her Lord, the king and God at Sriranga.</p>

<p>This is a temple dedicated to Goddess Andal. Here every devotee worships Goddess Godha Devi. <br>
Andal, also known as Kothai, Nachiyar, and Godadevi, was the only female Alvar among the twelve poet-saints of South India.<br>
She was considered to be the human incarnation of the Goddess Bhudevi. <br>
As with the Alvar saints, she was affiliated to the Sri Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism. <br>
Praying to Goddess Andal will bestow the individual with peace, problem-free and happy life.</p>
